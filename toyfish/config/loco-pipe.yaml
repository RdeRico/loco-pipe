  # reference genome to be approximately at chromosome level. In other words, we advice against a highly fragmented 
  # reference genome (e.g. L80 > 100). Due to the fact that many downstream analyses are performed at
  # chromosome/scaffold/contig level, having a highly-fragmented reference genome will create too many parallel jobs and might
